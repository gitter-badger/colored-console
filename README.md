Bau is a community driven, cross platform, pluggable task runner built on the [scriptcs](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs) + [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) ecosystem.

The core Bau library is a [script pack](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Script-Packs) providing task definition, dependencies between tasks and task running.

Extensions are provided by [plugins](https://github.com/bau-build/bau/wiki/Plugins), taking advantage of Bau's modular, pluggable architecture.

##### Task definition
[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/colored-console/colored-console?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
```C#
// baufile.csx
Require<Bau>().Do(() => Console.WriteLine("Hello world!")).Run();
```

##### Dependencies between tasks
```C#
// baufile.csx
string message;

Require<Bau>()
	.DependsOn("world")
	.Do(() => Console.WriteLine(message))
.Task("world")
	.DependsOn("hello")
	.Do(() => message += " world!")
.Task("hello")
	.Do(() => message = "Hello")
.Run();
```
Tasks can be defined in any order, can depend on any number of other tasks `DependsOn("foo", "bar")`, can be referenced multiple times with multiple calls to `Task("baz")` and can have multiple actions assigned to them with multiple calls to `Do()`.

##### Running tasks
```batch
scriptcs baufile.csx
```
